<h2>Figuring out the FB SDK</h2>
<p>When I first saw the Facebook SDK, I was a little overwhelmed.<br>
   Maybe it was because I was new to web development but now I<br>
   want to take the time to figure it out and help anyone else<br>
   along the way. Please let me know if there's anything I'm<br>
   missing or could do better</p>
